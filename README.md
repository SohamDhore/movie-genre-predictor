# Movie Genre Predictor

Welcome to the **Movie Genre Predictor**! This is a fun and interactive web app built with Python and Flask that predicts your favorite movie genre based on a few simple inputs: your age, gender, favorite actor, and a genre you’ve watched recently. It uses a decision tree (a type of machine learning model) to make the prediction, making it a great beginner project to explore both web development and AI!

Hi, I’m **Soham Sachin Dhore**, and I created this project on **February 23, 2025**, to blend my love for coding, machine learning, and movies. Whether you’re here to try it out or learn from it, I hope you enjoy it!

Imagine you’re wondering, “What movie genre suits me today?” This app asks you four quick questions and uses a decision tree trained on movie data to guess your preferred genre—Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance, or Thriller. It’s like a movie quiz with a tech twist!
